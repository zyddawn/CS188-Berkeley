        A perceptron classifies data points as either belonging to a particular
        class (+1) or not (-1). `dimensions` is the dimensionality of the data.
        For example, dimensions=2 would mean that the perceptron must classify
        2D points.

        get_data_and_monitor yields data points one at a time. It also takes the

        graphics in between yielding data points.
